            to get a feel for how to design a website.

        <p>
            I really enjoyed experimenting with the media queries once I got the page to flow the way I wanted to.
            The downside I had for this project was that I had to change most of my code from Lab 1 to make it more confortable
            to fit in media queries more effectively.

        <p>
            Coding event handlers and classes for this lab was a hassle because of how much content was in the descriptions. The functions of event handlers were very simple
            but debugging them were difficult and contained many console and alert calls to figure out what was broken inside the code. On top of that, dynamically changing the
            images depending on the selection of the dropdown list and creating list nodes to append to the div when users add an item for an order was exciting to see once I
            got it to work!
